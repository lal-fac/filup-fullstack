# Welcome to my Filup Fullstack Developer Application

## Intro

This small app consists of a backend and a frontend. It's data is provided directly through PokeApi.
To run it, you need to have a working IDE and Node.js installed.

## Setup

To run the app, use the command line to navigate to `filup-fullstack\server`. There, enter the following commands:

> `npm install`

> `npm run`

Navigate to `filup-fullstack\client` and repeat the procedure.

Please make sure that no other servers are running on localhost:3000 and localhost:3001.

## Usage

This simple app allows the user to limit the amount of Pokemon names displayed per page, move from one page to the next and search the list for a specific name.
It also has a button that allows the user to print the current window and save it to a pdf.

## Code

The code was created according to the specifications provided by the _FullStack Test Filup 2024_ file
